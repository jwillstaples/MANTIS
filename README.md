## Efficiency Improvement

Neural Network Input Efficiency:

* Passing 10 boards at a time, 200 times takes 2.5 seconds (800 evals/sec)
* Passing 100 boards at a time, 200 times takes 5.6 seconds (3500 evals/sec)
* Passing 1000 boards at a time, 200 times takes 37.27 seconds (5366 evals/sec)
* Passing 5000 boards at a time, 200 times takes 187 seconds (5347 evals/sec)
* Passing 1 board, 2000 times takes 16.74 seconds (120 evals/sec)
* Passing 1 board, 20000 times takes 180 seconds (110 evals/sec)

Connect Four:

(30 games)

Pre-tree passing: 40 sec/game
Tree Passing: 8 sec/game
Parallel, no tree passing: 9 sec / game
Parallel, tree passing: 7 sec / game

(300 games)

Pre-tree passing: 40 sec/game
Tree Passing: 8 sec/game
